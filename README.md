# blog-static

Static files, scripts, embeds, etc. for my personal blog, [candu can do](https://www.savageevan.com/).

## Hey! This is mine!

This is a public repository, but the contents are mine: they're intended for use on my personal blog, and are not intended for reuse without permission. I've deliberately not included a `LICENSE` file here.

If you'd like to use or embed something here, please reach out to me first!

## Notes to self

### What should go here?

Interactive explanations to be embedded in blog posts. Anything else that can't easily be added as a block through the Ghost editor. These should go in `public`.

Any supporting tools / configs / etc. should go in the root directory.

### What should not go here?

In general: actual content here should be my own creation, though it can link to other libraries.

- externally-hosted JS libraries: use an existing CDN instead!
- images / videos: use the Ghost editor itself!
- math formulas: use MathJax in the blog post itself!
